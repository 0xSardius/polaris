# ✦ Polaris

> Your AI guide to achieving your North Star

Transform one ambitious goal into 64 daily actions using the Ohtani/Harada Method. Track progress with an AI coach that adapts.

## 🎯 What is Polaris?

Polaris is an AI-powered goal coaching app built for the [Encode Club "Commit To Change" Hackathon](https://www.encodeclub.com/programmes/comet-resolution-v2-hackathon).

**The Problem:** 92% of resolutions fail because they're vague, lack a system, and have no accountability.

**The Solution:** Polaris uses the same methodology that helped Shohei Ohtani become a baseball legend—breaking one big goal into 8 supporting pillars and 64 specific daily actions, with AI coaching to keep you on track.

## ✨ Features

- **AI-Guided Goal Crafting** — Conversational wizard to define your goal, pillars, and actions
- **Visual Mandala** — 9x9 heat map showing your progress across all 64 actions
- **Natural Language Check-ins** — Just tell Polaris what you did, it maps to your actions automatically
- **Adaptive Coaching** — AI notices patterns, celebrates streaks, nudges cold pillars
- **Opik Observability** — Full tracing of coaching effectiveness for continuous improvement

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Framework:** Next.js 14 (App Router)
- **Database:** Convex (real-time)
- **Auth:** Clerk
- **AI:** Claude Sonnet 4.5 via Vercel AI SDK
- **Observability:** Opik by Comet
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui

- Primary: Polaris gold (`#fbbf24`)
- Heat states: Cold → Warming → Warm → Hot → Fire

## 📊 Hackathon Categories

Targeting:
- **Best Use of Opik** ($5,000) — Full observability of AI coaching effectiveness
- **Personal Growth & Learning** ($5,000) — Harada Method implementation

## 📖 The Harada Method

Created by Takashi Harada and famously used by Shohei Ohtani:

1. **1 Goal** — Specific, measurable, time-bound
2. **8 Pillars** — Balanced supporting areas (not just skills)
3. **64 Actions** — Daily behaviors, not outcomes

Ohtani's high school chart included "keep room clean" and "be caring" alongside baseball skills. Balance matters.
